BOOK SHOP AUTOMATION SOFTWARE(Course Project) March 2023 - April 2023
Software Engineering Project under Prof. Abir Das and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya
● Developed a Web-Based Book Shop Automation Software, that helps customers to
find, order new books, raise queries for unavailable ones and track their purchase
details.
● Designed the frontend of the website using ReactJS Framework, and a
Python-based micro web framework Flask is used for backend, while the Database
Management is done with sqlite3 library.
● The software works for 4 different types of users- owner,manager, clerk , customers. Different secret keys have been
implemented for the 4 different types of users.
● Designed an interface for users to SignIn/SignOut from the portal. Added the feature
of Email Verification for new users through OTP using the smtplib library.
● Used flask_bcrypt library to generate and store a hashed form of the password of the
user, which provides more security to the users.
● Added a feature that when an user orders a book, a Confirmation Receipt is sent to
the user in PDF Format using pdf_mail library imported from send_pdf.
● Explored various stages of Software Development Life Cycle including SRS
Preparation and designing of UML Diagrams and Class Diagrams.
Spring Fest 2023 - Official Website Dec 2022 - Jan 2023
● Worked on the mobile version of the website, in a team of 5 members, using
ReactJS and designed it using CSS.
● Made a registration form for the users to register for the events of Spring Fest , using
formik library in ReactJS, and the validation of the entered data is done using the
Yup library.
● Fetched the data of the events from the API using react-axios library, and made a
page to display the rules and regulations of each of the events.
● Developed a hamburger menu on the landing page and used it to navigate to
various pages of the website using react-router-dom library.
● Developed a toast component to display error/success messages,passed as
parameters through React based Props, for 5 seconds, implemented using
setTimeout function.
Winter School of AI and Robotics, IIT Kharagpur March 2022 - April 2022
● Designed a Maze Solver using OpenCV Computer Vision Library by generating a
random matrix using Numpy library, and then used it on other input images.
● Applied various pathfinding algorithms like Breadth First Search and Depth First
Search for unweighted graphs to get the shortest path.
● Executed A-star and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm with Euclidean distance as an
admissible heuristic to find the optimal path between source and destination.
