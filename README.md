BOOK SHOP AUTOMATION SOFTWARE(Course Project) March 2023 - April 2023

Software Engineering Project under Prof. Abir Das and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya

● Developed a Web-Based Book Shop Automation Software, that helps customers to
find, order new books, raise queries for unavailable ones and track their purchase
details.

● Designed the frontend of the website using ReactJS Framework, and a
Python-based micro web framework Flask is used for backend, while the Database
Management is done with sqlite3 library.

● The software works for 4 different types of users- owner,manager, clerk , customers. Different secret keys have been
implemented for the 4 different types of users.

● Designed an interface for users to SignIn/SignOut from the portal. Added the feature
of Email Verification for new users through OTP using the smtplib library.

● Used flask_bcrypt library to generate and store a hashed form of the password of the
user, which provides more security to the users.

● Added a feature that when an user orders a book, a Confirmation Receipt is sent to
the user in PDF Format using pdf_mail library imported from send_pdf.

● Explored various stages of Software Development Life Cycle including SRS
Preparation and designing of UML Diagrams and Class Diagrams.
